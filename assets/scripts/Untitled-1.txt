When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

//--> take the difference between current time and start time and divide it by the frequency, take the modulus and subtract it from the frequency <--\\

Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
